#### (MERN Full CRUD Application)

## ~ Overview

This app is a modern technology inspired by the design of Amazon's app for delivery drivers as the user rather than something that focuses on client side retail -- this application focuses on the business side for user experience and user stories.

## ~ App Features

#### - User authentication for signing up and logging in/out, a user can stay logged in for up to 24 hours before expiration takes place.

#### - A user (once logged in) has the ability to create tickets for their shipped packages ready to be delivered, which include some data structures such as: Package Weight, Item Quantity, Recipient Name & Address, Delivery Status and Delivery Priority which is categorized by a delivery timeframe system (similar to Amazon same day delivery, two day delivery, etc). 

#### - As a route is fulfilled by the user, they can modify and update the delivery status from "shipped" to a variety of options such as, including: "Delivered on Doorstep", "Unable to Deliver", and "Left with Resident".

#### - A user is welcome by a pinned post as they return to the main page from being redirected after logging in.

#### - Lastly, a user has the option to delete any deliveries, for best practice, once they have updated the order to "Delivered" it is suggested they delete the delivery to avoid confusion.
